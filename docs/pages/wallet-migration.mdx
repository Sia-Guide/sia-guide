:::details[What is the difference betweeen SC and SF?]
- Siacoin (SC) is the cryptocurrency powering the network. Renters pay for storage in SC and hosts earn SC for their service. Miners also earn SC for their block creation services, which provide security to the network and finally the Siafund holders receive SC as well.
- Siafund (SF) is the supplementary coin of the network that is utilized for revenue sharing, where a 3.9% fee from every storage-related transaction on the Sia network is split between all of the Siafund holders. See more details in the official [Sia docs](https://docs.sia.tech/siafunds/learn-about-siafunds).
